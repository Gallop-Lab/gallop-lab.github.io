Students can be funded to join the lab via studentships from a variety of sources. We occasionally have positions available for postdocs and we welcome applicants for external postdoctoral fellowships. 

If you are interested in joining us please send your CV and a covering email describing your interests and motivations to [Jenny](mailto:jlg38@cam.ac.uk).
