Jenny and Hanae present our work to the public at the Science Festival. They are using EMIDO blocks and plastic bags to explain how the actin cytoskeleton assembles and structures the cell. We had lots of young visitors exploring actin assemblies (see photo).

Jenny attends and presents our work at the Biochemistry Department (link) Away Days, good to catch up with friends and collaborators in the Department and from MedImmune (link)
