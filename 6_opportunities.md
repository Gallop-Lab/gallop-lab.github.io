A postdoc position is available! [See advert](http://www.jobs.cam.ac.uk/job/26452/)

We are looking for a neuronal cell biologist or microscopy expert to unravel what is happening at the membrane during the initial protrusion and elongation stages when filopodia form. The project uses quantitative and super-resolution microscopy and there are opportunities for various types of neuronal cultures. The lab has trained 9 postdocs so far. One has an independent academic position and another is currently applying for independent positions. Two have moved into industry, one has taken a career break, another moved into government/policy and four have moved to further research associate positions. Everyone has published their work from the lab.

Students can be funded to join the lab via studentships from external funders. If you are interested in joining us please send your CV and a covering email describing your interests and motivations to [Jenny](mailto:jlg38@cam.ac.uk).
