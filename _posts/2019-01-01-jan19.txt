Our newest manuscript on actin dynamics and the variable composition of actin regulatory proteins is up on the [bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/525725).

Jenny enjoyed participating in a Company of Biologists workshop on reconstituting the cell cytoskeleton, giving a talk and interacting with colleagues.

We are lucky to have two excellent Part II students from the Department of Biochemistry join us for their eight week projects.
