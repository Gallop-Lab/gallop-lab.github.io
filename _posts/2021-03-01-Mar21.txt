Congratulations to Uli, Iris, Yoshiko, Hanae and most of the lab from the past 10 years! Key theory collaboration with Ben Simons and Edouard Hannezo. We were puzzled for a long time about how actin regulatory proteins work together to make filopodia and filopodia-like structures: [our new paper](https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202003052) describes what we found and our latest models.
